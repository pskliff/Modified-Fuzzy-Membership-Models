## Code structure
`/ulib`:  
*  `modelling`: methods to create ml and dl models  
*  `pipelines`: pipeline classes to fit-predict ml and dl models in FMM context  
-  `plotting`: methods to plot decision boundaries  
-  `experiments`: classes that implement FMM algorithm with given models  

`./Experiments.ipynb`: Experimental environment on 3 datasets
